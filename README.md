# Comprehensive Guide to Algorithms in C

## Overview
This repository provides a structured guide to graph algorithms and dynamic programming techniques, with a focus on implementations in C. Topics include:

### Graph Algorithms
- *Bellman-Ford Algorithm*: Single-source shortest path for graphs with negative weights.
- *Dijkstra's Algorithm*: Single-source shortest path using a priority queue.
- *Prim's Algorithm*: Minimum spanning tree using a greedy approach.
- *Kruskal's Algorithm*: Minimum spanning tree using union-find.

### Dynamic Programming
- *Huffman Coding*: Optimal encoding for data compression.
- *Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)*: Finding the longest subsequence common to two strings.
- *Matrix Chain Multiplication*: Minimizing scalar multiplications for matrix multiplication.
- *Activity Selection Problem*: Selecting the maximum number of non-overlapping activities.

The *PDF document* contains theoretical insights, problem definitions, and well-documented C code implementations.
